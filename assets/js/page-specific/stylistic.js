Four days will quickly steep themselves in nights;","Four nights will quickly dream away the time; And then the moon, like to a silver bow New bent in heaven, shall behold the night Of our solemnities. Go, Philostrate, Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;","Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth; Turn melancholy forth to funerals The pale companion is not for our pomp. Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,","And won thy love doing thee injuries; But I will wed thee in another key, With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling. Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke! Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?","Full of vexation come I, with complaint Against my child, my daughter Hermia. Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,","This man hath my consent to marry her: Stand forth, Lysander; and, my gracious duke, This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child.","Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes, And interchang'd love-tokens with my child: Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,","With feigning voice, verses of feigning love; And stol'n the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits, Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers","Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth; With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart; Turned her obedience, which is due to me, To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious duke, Be it so she will not here before your grace","Consent to marry with Demetrius, I beg the ancient privilege of Athens, As she is mine I may dispose of her: Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death; according to our law","Immediately provided in that case. What say you, Hermia? be advis'd, fair maid: To you your father should be as a god;"]

He steps out and begins to briskly walk towards the entrance. He stomps along the walkways. Across the crossings. Into the lift. Up the escalator. Through the cafeteria. The coffee shop. The entrance.","The homewares section. One path, infinite routes. Time to look for Lexi. Morris ventures down the predestined path, indicated by the yellow arrows stenciled onto the floor. He shuffles past newlyweds, business assistants, couples, mothers, fathers, children. A gardener. A doctor. A teacher. None of them were Lexi. They were all looking at the same furniture. All seeing different things.","Morris walks. He walks past the variations of bed linen, the variations of alarm clock, the variations of faucet, the variations of mug, of spoon, of lamp. He notices a couple bickering about a style of curtain.","And then he finds her."]
