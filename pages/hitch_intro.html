		  <p class="fade start_sentences first">Why hello there reader! What a delightful <span class="time">Evening</span> it is, don't you think?</p>
			<p class='fade' >You're sitting here. Reading this. I'm sitting here. Writing this. Doing ... whatever fictional narrators do. Is there any other place you'd rather be?</p>
			<p class='fade'>I thought not.</p>
			<p class='fade trigger-ambient'>Oh my, I almost forgot to introduce myself. How dreadfully rude of me! My name is Alfie. And I shall be your host for this <span class="time">Evening</span>.</p>
		  <p class="fade start_sentences">But let's cut the chit chat shall we? What are you here for? Well, today I'm going to tell you a story.</p>
			<p class="fade">More specifically, you're going to read a story. A story that I wrote. Myself. With my own bare ... figurative hands.</p>
		  <p class="fade start_sentences">You might like it. You might not. But youâ€™re going to read it anyway.</p>
			<p class="fade" >You're going to lap up those words, those sentences, those glyphs.</p>
		  <p class="fade start_sentences">Youâ€™re going to sit on that chair and be influenced! <em>My</em> thoughts, <em>my</em> speculation, <em>my</em> thinking all </p>

		  <p class="fade">This is the story of a character named Morris. Morris' sole purpose is to entertain you. He's pretty great like that.</p>
			<p class="fade">Morris' name was chosen for the specific reason that it is uncommon enough (only one in eighteen thousand, two hundred and fifty eight!) in the target demographic that it might ilicit some kind of memorable experience for the reader. I choose that name for him.</p>
		  <p class="fade">However, standard default text can do the trick. JavaScript has the awesome power to manipulate DOM elements on the fly. People tend to read writing. Humans are creative beings.</p>
