		  <h1>Good <span class="time">Evening</span>,</h1>
		  <p class="fade start_sentences first">Hello there reader. What a delightful <span class="time">Evening</span> it is, don't you think?</p>
			<p class='fade' >You’re sitting here. Reading this. I’m sitting here. Writing this, doing … whatever fictional narrators do. Is there any other place you’d rather be?</p>
			<p class='fade'>I thought not.</p>
			<p class='fade trigger-ambient'>Oh, I almost forgot to introduce myself. My name is Alfie, and I shall be your host for this <span class="time">Evening.</span></p>
		  <p class="fade start_sentences">But what are you here for? Well, dear participant, we’re going to investigate a murder.</p>
			<p class='fade'>The death of a dog.</p>
			<p class='fade'>The slaughter of communication.</p>
			<p class='fade'><em>The Murder of Meaning</em></p>
			<p class="fade">More specifically, you’re going to read a story about a murder. A story that I wrote. Myself. With my own, bare … figurative hands.</p>
		  <p class="fade start_sentences">You might like it. You might not. But you’re going to read it anyway.</p>
			<p class="fade" >You’re going to sit on that chair and be influenced! Just think: My, thoughts, my speculation, my opinion - a major contributing factor to your own thinking and understanding.</p>
			<div style='height:50px;'></div>
		  <p class="fade">This is the story of a character named Morris. Morris’ sole purpose is to entertain you. He’s pretty great like that. </p>
			<p class="fade">Morris’ name was chosen for a specific reason; it is uncommon enough in the target demographic (only one in eighteen thousand, two hundred and fifty eight!) that it might elicit some kind of memorable experience for the reader.<br> <em>I</em> have chosen that name for him.</p>
		  <p class="fade">Morris will find himself in a difficult situation. He will embark upon a journey of vengeance and retribution.<br> <em>I</em> put Morris in that difficult situation.</p>
			<p class='fade'>Finally, Morris will succeed. You, dear reader, will feel a sense of great euphoria after finally receiving resolution. Morris’ quest will be complete. The story will be over.<br> <em>I</em> have decided that final line.</p>
			<p class='fade'>Morris’ story is already written.<br><em>I</em> wrote it.</p>
			<div style='height:50px;'></div>
			<p class='fade'>A story of such grandeur deserves an equally fitting title. A first impression for my reader to peruse over. A first glimpse at meaning.</p>
			<p class="fade">I think I shall call it:</p>
			<center>
				<h2 class='fade'><em>Morris: A life and times</em></h2>
			</center>
			<p class="fade">No. Far too vague. How about this:</p>
			<center>
				<h2 class='fade'><em>The Story of Morris, Lexi, A Dog Named Tank and Their Fantastic Adventure of IKEA Furniture, Loose Screws and Dead Pets.</em></h2>
			</center>
			<p class="fade">Nothing up to interpretation now! They’ll get the gist straight away. But perhaps it uses a little too much ink. Let’s truncate it:</p>
			<center>
				<h2 class='fade'><em>The Story of Morris.</em></h2>
			</center>
			<p class="fade">Perfect.</p>
			<div style='height:150px;'></div>

			<p class="fade"><em>But who died?!</em> You might ask, aghast with the thought of a dead corpse on your doorstep. </p>
			<p class="fade">Well, this person passed away half a century ago. This person perished after the bomb dropped. When everything was up in the air, when nothing was certain. When that vile fellow Barthes decided he would slaughter the author with his own, bare text. Ugh.</p>
			<p class="fade">Observe! This narrative of mine. This wonderful Story of Morris. I have imbued so much into its very essence.<br> Love. Hatred. Passion. Deceit. Anxiety. Revenge.</p>
			<p class="fade">You’re going to read my story today. But will you feel these things that are most certainly there? Will you have some other experience as the result of your own, prior context? What if you don’t feel for Morris. What if we don’t achieve a mutual connection? What if you don’t get <em>it.</em></p>
			<p class="fade">Then you wouldn't get:</p>
			<div class="flowcontent flow the_meaning">
				<div class="imageholder img1"></div>

			    <div class="caption caption_center">
				    	<h2>The Meaning</h2>
			    </div>
				</center>
		  </div>
			<p class="fade" id="meaning_finish">I mean. I know Barthes would be wincing at all this divine imagry and allusion to <em>"it"</em> as a single theological meaning. The divine and sole message of the Author-God. </p>
			<p class='fade'>But just think. All that meaning! Wasted! Lost!</p>
			<center>
				<p class='fade'><em>Murdered.</em></p>
			</center>
			<div style='height:150px;'></div>
			<p class="fade">What a tragedy.</p>
			<div style='height:150px;'></div>
			<p class="fade">Am I really dead to you? The Author of this fine narrative? When the “voice loses its origin”, and “the author enters his own death”, is it only then that <em>writing begins.</em></p>
			<p class="fade">Look outside on this <span class="time-day">Friday</span> <span class="time">Afternoon</span>! It’s <span class="time-year">2017</span>. 40 years later is this perpetrator’s homicide really still relevant? In the age of hyperlinks, user-generated content, fake profiles and manipulated media who makes up the content that sits aside this story? What trust do we place in the author today? Who writes this when everyone is behind a screen, completely anonymous.</p>
			<p class="fade">Let’s read this story <em>together</em>. Audience and author reunited once more. Let’s investigate this supposed murder in the modern age. A time when consumers and producers are one and the same. When readers and writers are synonymous.</p>
			<p class="fade">Go ahead. Flick the switch. Let’s turn off these stage lights and reveal what is truly behind facade of this story. Make the first leap. <em>Read as if you are writing.</em> The author may be dead ladies and gentlemen, but you, dear reader, are well and truly alive.</p>
