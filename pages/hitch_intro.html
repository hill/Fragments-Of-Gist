		  <h1>Good <span class="time">Evening</span>,</h1>
		  <p class="fade start_sentences first">Why hello there reader! What a delightful <span class="time">Evening</span> it is, don't you think?</p>
			<p class='fade' >You're sitting here. Reading this. I'm sitting here. Writing this. Doing ... whatever fictional narrators do. Is there any other place you'd rather be?</p>
			<p class='fade'>I thought not.</p>
			<p class='fade trigger-ambient'>Oh my! I almost forgot to introduce myself. How dreadfully rude of me! My name is Alfie. And I shall be your host for this <span class="time">Evening</span>.</p>
		  <p class="fade start_sentences">But let's cut the chit chat shall we? What are you here for? Well, today I'm going to tell you a story.</p>
			<p class="fade">More specifically, you're going to read a story. A story that I wrote. Myself. With my own bare ... figurative hands.</p>
		  <p class="fade start_sentences">You might like it. You might not. But youâ€™re going to read it anyway.</p>
			<p class="fade" >You're going to lap up those words, those sentences, those glyphs.</p>
		  <p class="fade start_sentences">Youâ€™re going to sit on that chair and be influenced! Just think: <em>My</em> thoughts, <em>my</em> imagination, <em>my</em> speculation: a major contributing factor to your own thinking. Marvelous.</p>
			<div style='height:50px;'></div>
		  <p class="fade">This is the story of a character named Morris. Morris' sole purpose is to entertain you. He's pretty great like that.</p>
			<p class="fade">Morris' name was chosen for the specific reason that it is uncommon enough (only one in eighteen thousand, two hundred and fifty eight!) in the target demographic that it might ilicit some kind of memorable experience for the reader. <br> <em>I</em> have choosen that name for him.</p>
		  <p class="fade">Morris will find himself in a difficult situation. He will embark on a journey of revenge and retribution. A journey of vengence.<br> <em>I</em> put Morris in that difficult situation.</p>
			<p class='fade'>Finally, Morris will succeed. You, dear reader, will feel a sense of great euphoria after finally recieveing resolution. Morris' quest will be complete. The story will be over.<br><em>I</em> have decided that final line.</p>
			<p class='fade'>Morris' story is already written.<br><em>I</em> wrote it.</p>
			<div style='height:50px;'></div>
			<p class='fade'>And a story of such grandeur deserves a fitting title. A first impression for my newfound readers. A first glimpse at meaning.</p>
			<p class="fade">I think I shall call it:</p>
			<center>
				<h2 class='fade'><em>The Morris Chronicles</em></h2>
			</center>
			<p class="fade">Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. No. How about:</p>
			<center>
				<h2 class='fade'><em>Morris: A life and times</em></h2>
			</center>
			<p class="fade">No. Far too vauge. How about this:</p>
			<center>
				<h2 class='fade'><em>The Story of Morris, Jen, A Dog Named Tank and Their Fantastic Adventure of Ikea Furnature, Loose Screws and Dead Pets.</em></h2>
			</center>
			<p class="fade">Ah fantastic. Nothing up to interpretation now! They'll get the gist straight away! They'll love it.</p>
			<div style='height:150px;'></div>
			<p class="fade">But what if they don't? What if <em>you</em> don't?</p>
			<p class="fade">What if you don't love it? What if you are not entertained? What if that this is all for nothing?</p>
			<p class="fade">I would be awfully dissapointed.</p>
			<p class="fade"><strike>Then they</strike> then YOU would not understand.</p>
			<p class="fade">Then you wouldn't get it.</p>
			<p class="fade">You wouldn't get:</p>
			<center>
				<h2 class='fade'>The Message</h2>
			</center>
			<p class="fade">All that meaning! Wasted! Lost!</p>
			<div style='height:150px;'></div>
			<p class="fade">That would be sad.</p>
			<div style='height:150px;'></div>
			<p class="fade">Oh! I know! What if ...</p>
			<p class="fade">... and I know I'm being awfully spontaneous here ...</p>
			<p class="fade">... what if we read the story together!</p>
			<p class="fade">You could have input!</p>
			<p class="fade">You could have a chance at changing the narrative.</p>
			<p class="fade">I mean. I think it will be pretty difficult to improve upon:</p>
			<center>
				<h2 class='fade'><em>The Story of Morris, Jen, A Dog Named Tank and Their Fantastic Adventure of Ikea Furnature, Loose Screws and Dead Pets.</em></h2>
			</center>
			<p class='fade'>... for it is flawless. But I suppose we could at least try.</p>
			<p class='fade'>For the reader's sake.</p>
			<p class='fade'>For your sake.</p>
			<p class='fade'>For the sake of meaning!</p>
			<div style='height:50px;'></div>
			<p class="fade">Oh yes I like this idea. I like this idea alot. Let's read this story <em>together</em>! Finally, author and audience united once more! It'll be like the classical times. Like the greeks. Direct narration and interjection from the narrator. </p>
			<div style='height:50px;'></div>
			<p class="fade">Finally you can have your say in the story, just ...</p>
