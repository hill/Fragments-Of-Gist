		<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>The furball hissed and scratched as Morris held it at a meter's distance away from his face. Carbucketty. What a dreadful cat.</p>
<p>Lexi loved it of course. But retribution is retribution. Debts must be payed. All action has consequence. You leave a  screw out, you must suffer the result. Just like Morris suffered.</p>
<p>Morris strode out the door and walked out towards the road, cat in hand.</p>
<p>A continuous convoy of cars drove through the roads. The perpetual sound of motor everywhere you turned in the city. There were always cars.</p>
<p>There’s one right now.</p>
<p>Morris throws the cat.</p>
<p>It hits the bumper falls to the grounds and it’s limp body goes under the wheel.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p>Morris hugs Lexi. What a terrible thing to have happened. Two unrelated deaths on the same day. How dreadful!</p>

    <div class="narration right">

      <p>Retribution achieved. Debts paid. Everything is at equilibrium.</p>
      <p>How absolutely wonderful.</p>
