		<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

    <div>
      <p>Finally the traffic clears. Morris is on his way! Morris slams on the accelerator, his foot practically touching the floor.</p>
      <p>IKEA is in Morris’ sights. The big blue and gold signage looms ahead. Four letters. Infinite pronunciations. Morris skids into parking. The car is engulfed by darkness. He steps out and begins to briskly walk towards the entrance. He stomps along the walkways. Across the crossings. Into the lift. Up the escalator. Through the cafeteria. The coffee shop. The entrance.</p>
      <p>The homewares section. One path, infinite routes. Time to look for Lexi. Morris ventures down the predestined path, indicated by the yellow arrows stenciled onto the floor. He shuffles past newlyweds, business assistants, couples, mothers, fathers, children. A gardener. A doctor. A teacher. None of them were Lexi. They were all looking at the same furniture. All seeing different things.</p>
      <p>Morris walks. He walks past the variations of bed linen, the variations of alarm clock, the variations of faucet, the variations of mug, of spoon, of lamp. He notices a couple bickering about a style of curtain.</p>
			<p>And then he finds her.</p>
    </div>

		<div class="narration">
			<p>So Morris goes to IKEA and tells Lexi off. Great. But I feel this is getting a little bland. We need to change up the style.</p>
			<p>Why don't we imitate some of the greats. Shakespeare. He'll do. Let's copy and paste, mix and match until his creation, his meaning becomes my own.</p>
			<p>After all, that's what I'm doing already.</p>

      <p>As Bartes says in <em>The Death of the Author</em>, <em>"the writer can only immitate a gesture forever anterior, never original"</em></p>
			<p>So what is the point of writing something new?</p>
