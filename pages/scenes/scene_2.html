		<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

		<p>Morris turned the key and entered the apartment. He stepped into the warzone. A sea of white IKEA instruction pamphlets camouflaged the floor. Half-assembled tables littered the kitchen as packaging swamped the couch.</p>
		<p>Piles of <em>Fjäderklint</em>, <em>Vindum</em> and <em>Bekkestua.</em></p>
		<p>How could Lexi possibly be this untidy?</p>
		<p>The cushions, on the other hand, were torn to shreds and scattered across the floor. Oh that little rascal. Only yesterday it had managed to turn the chairs into kindling and feathers. Actually quite the feat from a two kilo Chihuahua. Where was the pooch?</p>
		<p>And then Morris saw it. The pool of blood puddling under the <em>“Abelströpp”</em> bookcase. And there was Tank. His little tail poking out from a wreckage of furniture.</p>
		<p>And who put that bookcase together?<br>Lexi.</p>
		<p>Morris spotted the sixteen screws sitting upon the tabletop. His jaw began to grind. He could imagine Lexi’s voice in a hurry to buy more: <em>"They're spares! I'm sure of it."</em></p>

			<p>So you decide. Is it time for a little retribution? You knew this was going to happen. The tension was not <em>killing</em> you.</p>
