      <p>Isn’t this nice? You’re no longer tied to this story. You know what’s about to happen. You’re not <em>buried</em> under the constriction of surprise. You are liberated from all tension!</p>

		<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

		<p>Morris entered the apartment and stepped into the warzone. A sea of white IKEA instruction pamphlets camouflaged the floor. Half-assembled tables fortified the kitchen while barricades of packaging pilfer the couch. How could Lexi possibly be this untidy?</p>
		<p>The pillows, on the other hand, were torn to shreds and scattered across the floor. That bloody dog. Only yesterday it had managed to turn the chairs into kindling and feathers. It was actually quite the feat from a two kilo Chihuahua. Where was the pooch?</p>
		<p>And then Morris saw it. The pool of crimson blood puddling under the <em>"Abelströpp"</em> bookcase. And there was Tank. Nothing but a corpse crushed by this furniture. This furniture that was constructed by Lexi.</p>
		<p>Morris spotted the sixteen screws sitting upon the tabletop. His jaw began to grind. He could hear the echo of Lexi’s voice: <em>"They're spares! I'm sure of it."</em></p>

    <div class="narration right">
      <p>Poor Morris! Poor Tank.</p>
 			<p>How could Lexi possibly be this reckless?! It was obviously all her fault. But I really shouldn’t impart this opinion upon you.</p>
			<p>After all:<br><em>“Linguistically, the author is never anything more than the man who writes”</em> (Barthes)</p>
			<p>So you decide. Is it time for a little retribution? You knew this was going to happen. The tension was not <em>killing</em> you. Should Morris call Lexi and talk to her, or seek some other form of revenge because of her negligence?</p>
