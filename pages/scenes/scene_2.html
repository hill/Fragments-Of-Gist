      <p>Just smell that sweet scent of predestined fate. You're no longer tied to this story. You know what's about to happen. You are liberated from all tension. Isn't that just the best? So enjoyable.</p>

		<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

		<p>Morris turns to enter his apartment. He steps into the warzone. White IKEA instruction pamphlets anchored by allen keys line the floor. Half assembled tables fortify the kitchen while barricades of packaging pilfer the couch.</p>
		<p>Sawdust blanketed everything and cardboard particulates formed a grass of brown across the floor. “Damn it” Morris muttered as he pondered how Lexi could possibly be this untidy.</p>
		<p>Pillows were scattered across the floor. Half of them were torn to shreds. A flurry of feathers from the pillows forming a hurricane in the center of the room. The bloody dog. Only yesterday it had managed to turn the chairs into kindling and feathers. Actually quite the feat from a two kilo Chihuahua. Where is the pooch? “Tank! Tank?”. Not a yip, a yap or a yelp. Silence.</p>
		<p>And then Morris sees it. He winces. The pool of crimson puddling under the <em>“Laiva”</em> bookcase. It’s black wooden boards collapsed and broken under the weight of the paperbacks and hardcovers. Shards of wood splintered off the deformed structure.</p>
		<p>And there was Tank. A limp lifeless body.</p>
		<p>Crushed by this object.</p>
		<p>Crushed by this <em>Laiva.</em></p>
		<p>Crushed by this recently constructed piece of furniture.</p>
		<p>Constructed by Lexi.</p>
		<p>Morris spots the sixteen screws sitting upon the tabletop. Morris jaw began to grind. Morris can hear the echo of Lexi's voice: "They're spares! I'm sure of it."</p>


    <div class="narration right">
      <p>Oh dear. Poor Morris. Poor Tank.</p>
 			<p>How could Lexi possibly be this reckless?! It was obviously all her fault. Perhaps it’s time for a little retribution? Should Morris give Lexi a call or should he go seek some other revenge?</p>
