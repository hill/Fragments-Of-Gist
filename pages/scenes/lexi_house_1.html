		<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <p>Schrödinger hissed and scratched as Morris held the cat away from his face. He strode out onto the road. What a dreadful cat.</p>
    <p>Lexi adored the beast of course. But all debts must be payed. All action has consequence. You leave a screw out, you must suffer the result. Just like Morris suffered.</p>
    <p>The suffering wouldn’t last too long. Morris wasn’t a monster.</p>
    <p>He pinned the cat’s paws down with his forearm and picked up the cinder half-brick laying on the pavement. And then he dropped it.</p>
    <p>Crack.</p>
    <p>Morris tore into the corpse.</p>
    <p>Blood and bile and bone. Flesh and hair and liver. Lung. Esophagus. Small intestine. Nerve. Spleen. Fat. Diaphragm. Kidney.</p>
    <p>Chunks of meat go flying.</p>
    <p>This isn’t enough. These demons must die. Morris must rid the world of these creatures.</p>
    <p>Morris spots another. And another. And another. The felines flee from his fury.</p>

      <p>Well that was horrific. What a terrible thing to do! Those other cats, they weren’t even Lexi’s!</p>
      <p>Just think how this rampage will go down in the news and the media. This neighbourhood will be distraught! They will have opinions to express and things to say about the event.</p>
      <p>They certainly will not provide an objective recount of the events when the emotional trauma of their lost cats hit them...</p>
