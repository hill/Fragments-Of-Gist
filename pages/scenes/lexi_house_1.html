		<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

    <p>The furball hissed and scratched as Morris held it at a meter's distance away from his face. Carbucketty. What a dreadful cat.</p>
    <p>Lexi loved it of course. But retribution is retribution. Debts must be payed. All action has consequence. You leave a  screw out, you must suffer the result. Just like Morris suffered.</p>
    <p>Morris strode out the door and plucked a loose brick from the garden wall as he walked out onto the road, cat in hand.</p>
    <p>He lays the cat down and knelt down beside it.</p>
    <p>Holds it in position with his spare left forearm.</p>
    <p>Lifts the brick with his right hand.</p>
    <p>Crack.</p>
    <p>Carbucketty dies.</p>
    <p>Lifts the brick with his right hand.</p>
    <p>Crack.</p>
    <p>Lifts the brick with his right hand.</p>
    <p>Crack.</p>
    <p>Morris tore into the corpse.</p>
    <p>Blood and bile and bone. Flesh and hair and liver. Lung. Esophagus. Small intestine. Nerve. Spleen. Fat. Diaphragm. Kidney.</p>
    <p>Chunks of meat go flying.</p>
    <p>Morris drags the limp body across the road. Across the pavement. Across the brickwork. Red calligraphy caresses the concrete.</p>

      <p>Well. That was horrific.<br>
        What a terrible thing to do.<br>
        Psychologically stable people talk about their issues.<br>
        Unless they’re personal.<br>
        In which case most people don’t.<br>
        Maybe we’re not that different from Morris after all.</p>
