			<p>Oh I have a bad feeling about this… Morris is about to do something stupid.
But is Morris doing it, or are <em>you</em>? You chose this path after all.</p>

		<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>Schrödinger scrambled and scratched as Morris strode out onto the road, holding the cat at arm’s length.</p>
<p>Yes, Lexi adored the beast. And Morris adored Lexi. But all debts had to be payed. “You leave a screw out, you must suffer the result” Morris muttered.</p>
<p>The suffering wouldn’t last too long. Morris wasn’t a monster.</p>
<p>He pinned the cat’s paws down with his forearm and picked up a brick on the pavement. He raised it over Schrödinger’s fluffy face. </p>
<p>And then he slammed the brick. He slammed it hard.</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>Morris tore into the corpse.</p>
<p>Blood and bile and bone. Flesh and hair and liver. Kidney. Esophagus. Small intestine. Nerve. Spleen. Fat.<br>
	Diaphragm.<br>Lung.
</p>
<p>This wasn’t enough for Morris. He felt compelled to rid the whole city of these demons.</p>
<p>Morris spotted another and another. As if by instinct, the felines fled from his fury.</p>


    <div class="narration right">

		<p>Well that was horrific. Those other cats, they weren’t even Lexi’s!</p>
		<p>Just think how this rampage will go down in the media. People will have Opinions to Express. “Feelpinions” and “Opsplanations” will run rampant on the world wide web.</p>
		<p>They certainly will not provide an objective recount of the events. But the People of Today want immediacy and authenticity. Instant tweets and snaps. Who needs objectivity in the digital age?</p>
