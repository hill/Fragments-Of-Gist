			<p>Morris knew it was Lexi. She had a thing for not following instructions, and not reading the lines carefully. They’re not even words! They’re symbols!</p>
	    <p>Morris breathes a deep sigh. He stared at Tank. He’ll have to clean up the mess later. There’s a much more important job to deal with now. This woman, this girlfriend. Morris trusted her - they were going to move in together. He couldn’t believe it. How had he been so shortsighted to see this true evil that lay at his doorstep, that he let into his life. Now was the time to express his pain.</p>
	    <p>Morris left his apartment and found his car in lot thirty three of the garage. The engine revved and the car lurched forward as it hurtled down Carlisle street.</p>
	    <p>It’s time to make Lexi feel the consequences of her actions and frankly her disregard for Morris’ property and life!</p>

			<p>Do you see what I mean! It's a disaster! Even Proust has emphasized (pun not intended) the increadibly verbal and essentially chance nature of literature.</p>
			<p>I need to reduce all interpretation to the minimum. I need to spell out each and every syllable. The audience will say it just as I want and will get <em>only</em> my version of the meaning.</p>
			<p>But, as Bathes so wisely notes: <em>"literature is performative"</em>. So shall we perform? Place our own verbal nuances and intonation to shape our meaning. We shall finally gain that intimate connection between Author and Audience. You will finally understand.</p>
			<p>Should we perform our piece or dictate our piece in intense detail?</p>
