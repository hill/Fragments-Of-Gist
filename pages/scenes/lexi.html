    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>

		<div class="narration">
			<p>You might get the gist of what an author is trying to convey through lexical semantics, but will you really understand how an author experiences that meaning? We seem to kill some kind of intimacy when stories are told only with signs and characters.</p>

			<p>Furthermore, as my good friend <em>Saussure</em> has described in <em>Cour de Linguistique Generale</em>, the signifier, the signified and the referent can be completely disassociated with each other, leading us to perceive something completely different from the authorial intention.</p>

			<p>What about gestures? They provide a tool for the storyteller to apply additional semantics on top of a direct, spoken, intention.</p>

			<p><em>“Gestures are partial evidence for the shape of a speaker’s underlying linguistic processes. It gives a complete picture of the narrative event.”</em> (<em>Cassell</em> and <em>McNeill</em>)</p>

		<p>And then he found her.</p>
		<div class="conversation">
			<p class='c_left'>“Lexi!”</p>
			<p class='c_right'>“Morris? What are you doing here?”</p>
			<p class="c_left"><span class='giflinked' data-src='../../assets/img/expressions/open_hands.gif'>“Looking for you! Why weren’t you answering your phone?”</span></p>
			<p class="c_right">“Those devices, Morris, if you’d care to take a look, <span class='giflinked' data-src='../../assets/img/expressions/no.gif'>emit extremely toxic radiation to the natural self…</span>”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“I’ve had it up to here. Do you know what you’ve done you disgraceful human being”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“What?”</p>
			<p class="c_left"><span class='giflinked' data-src='../../assets/img/expressions/slam.gif'>“You’ve murdered Tank.”</span></p>
			<p class="c_right">“Excuse me?”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“He’s dead! The Abelströpp collapsed. <span class='giflinked' data-src='../../assets/img/expressions/pickout.gif'>Six screws weren’t in.</span> Who constructed the <em>Abelströpp</em> Lexi! Who built it? Huh? HUH?”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“You can not be blaming me for this right now. <span class='giflinked' data-src='../../assets/img/expressions/open_hands.gif'>I think you’re over reacting</span>”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“I’m really not. You’ve killed my dog”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“You know I recently saw my spiritual counsellor and he explicitly told me to remove all this negative energy from my life.”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“You’re being quite the source of negative energy right now Morris.”</p>
			<p class="c_left"><span class='giflinked' data-src='../../assets/img/expressions/stop.gif'>I do not care that you’re a fucking Taurus Lexi or any of this bullshit!</span>”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“He’s really great. Mr Tartu. Come on. Give him a call.”</p>

		</div>

    <div class="narration">
			<p>While gestures enhance the semiotic value of the phrase it accompanies, it only conveys the meaning of the person reciting the text. Does that mean the person reciting a text is therefore an author, creating meaning above what is already there through the medium of gesture?</p>
			<p>Do you become an author whenever you recite anything?</p>
			<p>Anyhoo, should Morris accept Lexi’s offer to call <em>Mr Tartu: World Famous Spiritual Healer</em>? Alternatively he could just reject Lexi completely. That would be satisfying.</p>
