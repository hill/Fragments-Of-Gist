    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>

		<div class="narration">
			<p>You might get the gist of <em>what</em> an Author is trying to convey through semantics, but will you really understand <em>how</em> an Author experiences that meaning? We seem to <em>kill</em> some kind of intimacy when stories are told only with signs and characters. </p>

			<p>Furthermore, as my good friend Saussure has described in <em>Cours de Linguistique Generale</em>, the signifier, the signified and the referent can be completely disassociated from each other. This leads us to perceive something completely different from the authorial intention.</p>

			<p>What a pickle.</p>

			<p>What about gestures? They provide a tool for the <em>storyteller</em> to apply additional semantics on top of a direct, spoken, intention. Cassell and McNeill are adamant that <em>“Gestures are partial evidence for the shape of a speaker’s underlying linguistic processes. It gives a complete picture of the narrative event”</em>. </p>

			<p>So let’s have a crack at this section with some different signifiers, shall we?</p>

			<p class="c_right">“Excuse me?”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“He’s dead! The Abelströpp collapsed. Six screws weren’t in. And it toppled and crushed him. Poor poppet.</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Tank? He’s...”</p>
			<p class="c_left">"Who constructed the Abelströpp Lexi? Huh?"</p>
			<p class="c_right"><span class='giflinked' data-src='../../assets/img/gestures/wave_stop.gif'>“You can not be blaming me for this right now.”</span></p>

			<p class="c_left">“I do not care about your fucking chakras Lexi”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“He’s really great. Mr Tartu. Come on, give him a call.”</p>

    <div class="narration">
			<p>McNeill and Cassell believe that while gestures enhance the semiotic value of the phrase it accompanies, they only convey the meaning of the person reciting the text.</p>
			<p>Does that mean the person reciting a text is therefore an author, creating meaning above what is already there through the medium of gesture?</p>
			<p>If that’s true, that would mean that you become an author whenever you recite anything.<br> Now that’s a can of worms.</p>
			<p>What would you find more satisfying, dear Co-conspirator?</p>
