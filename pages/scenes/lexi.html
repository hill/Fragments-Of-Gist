    <p>Morris watches the blonde figure over by the kitchen table section, he walks towards her.</p>

			<p class='c_right'>“Morris?”</p>
			<p class="c_right"><span class='giflinked' data-src='../../assets/img/gestures.gif'>“What are you doing here?”</span></p>
			<p class="c_left">“What are you doing here! We agreed we were weren’t going to buy the table”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Yes but look, the tables here are really just be....”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“... ah, I don’t want to hear it. Do you know what you’ve done?!”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Uh...no”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“If you had your bloody phone on you would”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Morris. The radiation those devices emit are toxic to your natural self”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“They’re really not”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“They are. But tell me Morris. What have I done”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“You’ve murdered Tank.”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Excuse me?”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“You’ve murdered him you disgraceful excuse for a human being. He’s dead!”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“What? How?”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“The Lavista collapsed. Six screws weren’t in. Who did the Lavista Lexi? Huh? Who build it.”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“You can not be blaming me for this right now.”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“I am blaming you for this right now. You are the problem Lexi! I can’t believe you didn’t screw them all in. THE LAVISTA COLLAPSED BECAUSE OF YOU LEXI!”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Calm down Morris!”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“Calm down? Calm down! How can I calm down? What were you thinking?”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Morris I think you’re over reacting right now. You know I recently saw my spiritual counsellor and he explicitly stated to remove all negative energy from my life.”</p>
      <p class='c_right'>“You’re quite the source of negative energy right now Morris”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“I don’t care you’re if you’re a fucking Taurus Lexi. You’re BEING A FUCKING BITCH”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Morris you should really go speak to this guy. Mr Tartu. He’s amazing a stress reduction and anxiety therapy”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“Are you serious?”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Yes! Come on. Give him a call.”</p>

      <p>Gosh. Didn’t those gestures really add to the story telling experience. It made it performative. It gave it another dimension.</p>
      <p><em>“Gestures are partial evidence for the shape of a speaker’s underlying linguistic processes. It gives a complete picture of the narrative event.”</em></p>
 			<p>Should Morris accept Lexi’s offer to call Mr Tartu: Spiritual Healer and Solver of other Problems. Alternatively he could just reject Lexi completely. That would be satisfying.</p>
