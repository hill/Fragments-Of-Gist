    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

		<p>Morris picks up the phone and dials.</p>
		<div class="conversation">
			<p class='c_left'>“Hello?”</p>
			<p class='c_right'>“Uh...Hello? I’m calling for Mr Tartu?”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“Ah yes! That would be me! I am Mr Tartu! World famous spiritual healer and advisor of other problems. Why do you call?”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Umm, well I picked up your card and it said…”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“… you have LIFE problems. Yes yes, You see? I know EXACTLY what is wrong.”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“you do?”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“Life troubles. Sex-u-al Impotence.”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Uh no.”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“A loved one.”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Yeah...”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“MURDERED!”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Um...well...I suppose. I guess”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“I knew it. Now. Mr Morris. I have very significant advice for you that will solve ALL of your problems"</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Okay...”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“Ahem. Your Tank is never dead. Your Lexi is not a killer. Your life is free because everything is free. Nothing dies. Nothing is born. Tank did not die. You were not born, for we are all a single being reinvented as everything else. I am you. You am I. Everything is everyone. A single consciousness.”</p>

    <div class="narration">
      <p>Hmmm, you see the problem here, dear participant, is that this advice is far too specific to Morris’ situation. We want meaning that comes out of nowhere. Meaning that the audience can relate to.</p>
 			<p><em>Apophenia</em> is the tendency to make meaningful connections out of unrelated noise.</p>
			<p>Let’s give the audience some noise dear reader. They’ll be able to take <em>any</em> meaning out.</p>
