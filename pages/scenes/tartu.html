    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

		<p>Morris picks up the phone and dials.</p>
		<div class="conversation">
			<p class='c_left'>“Hello?”</p>
			<p class='c_right'>“Uh...Hello? I’m calling for Mr Tartu?”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“Ah yes! I am Mr Tartu! World Famous Spiritual Healer and advisor of other problems. Why do you call?”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Umm, well I picked up your card and it said-”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“You have LIFE problems. Yes yes, you see? I know EXACTLY what is wrong.”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“Life troubles. Sex-u-al Impotence.”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Uh no.”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“A loved one.”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Yeah”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“MURDERED!”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Um...well...I suppose. I guess”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“I knew it. Now. Mr Morris. I have very significant advice for you that will solve ALL of your problems"</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Great!”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“Your Tank is never dead. Your Lexi is not a killer. Your life is free because everything is free. Nothing dies. Nothing is born. We are all a single being reinvented as everything else. I am you. You am I. Everything is everyone.”</p>

    <div class="narration">
      <p>Hmmm, you see the problem here, dear Participant, is that this advice is perhaps too specific to Morris’ situation. We want meaning that comes out of nowhere. Meaning that the audience can relate to.</p>
 			<p><em>Apophenia</em> is the tendency to make meaningful connections out of unrelated noise.</p>
			<p>So let’s turn up the noise. Then you can find any meaning you like!</p>
