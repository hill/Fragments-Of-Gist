    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

		<p>Well why not? Morris picks up the phone and dials.</p>
		<div class="conversation">
			<p class='c_left'>“Hello?”</p>
			<p class='c_right'>“Uh...Hello? I’m calling for Mr Tartu?”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“Ah yes! That would be me! I am Mr Tartu! World famous spiritual healer and advisor of other problems. Why do you call?”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Umm, well I picked up your card and it said…”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“Ah! My card! Excellent!”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Yeah, It said...”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“You must be having some problems”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Yea…”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“YOU SEE! I know EXACTLY what your problem is.”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Uh...”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“Life troubles. Sex-u-al Impotence.”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Uh no.”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“Spiritual disconnect”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Not really”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“A loved one.”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Yeah”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“MURDERED!”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Um...well...I suppose. I guess”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“I knew it. Well … uh …”</p>
			<p style='text-align:center;'>...</p>
			<p class="c_right">“... Morris”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“Well Mr Morris! Tell me this. Have you ever had a spiritual connection. A true spiritual connection?”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“I…”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“NOW tell me, Mr Morris. Do you believe in god. Do you believe in a higher power. In something greater than all this death and dismay. I have travelled the universe Mr Morris. I have seen things. Do you believe me?”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Not…uh...what was the question?”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“YOU SHOULD! I have very significant advice for you that will solve ALL of your problems Mr Morris. I am world famous from Nigeria you know.”</p>
			<p class="c_right">“Okay”</p>
			<p class="c_left">“Are you ready?”</p>
			<p style="text-align:center;font-style:bold;">“Your Tank is never dead. Your Lexi is not a killer. Your life is free because everything is free. Nothing dies. Nothing is born. We are all one and the same. A single being reinvented as everything else. I am you. You am I. Everything is everyone. A single consciousness.”</p>

      <p>No no no no no. Too specific. What’s the reader going to get out of that? It’s not relatable at all. Our audience will feel no connect if they don’t think it’s about them!
				We need it to be vague.</p>
 			<p>Let’s give it another go.</p>
