		<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
		<p>Morris dragged the flat pack up the flight of stairs. An enormous brown package with those four black lettered branded across the side. He heaved as the concrete bit into the cardboard covering, a powder of brown left in its trail. It was like dragging the Queen Mary through a marsh of molten mars bars! One final push.</p>
		<p>The door. Closed. Morris sighed as he thought about how aggravating his girlfriend Lexi had been over the past week. Moving to a new apartment was stressful enough, But choosing IKEA furniture with her was an absolute nightmare.</p>
		<p>This place was nice though. A minute’s walk to the park where he could throw a frisbee with his Chihuahua named Tank.</p>
		<p>“Lexi! Lexi!” Morris called. No response. She must have already gone back to IKEA for the second load. With one hand only, Morris reaches for the door handle. He clenched it and turned until it finally flung opened. Morris let go and the flatpack fell four flights of stairs. “Shit.”</p>

      <p>Oh dear! What a difficult situation Morris has found himself in! Morris was just <em>dying</em> to get into his apartment, but poor communication between himself and his beloved Lexi has left him somewhat inconvenienced. Shared understanding between two parties simply was not achieved. But already I feel like the story is getting a little dry. How about we spice it up.</p>
 			<p>The dog is going to have to die.</p>
 			<p>Oh! I'm so sorry. Spoilers! But really, as <em>Leavitt's and Christenfeld's</em> studies have shown, spoilers don't actually spoil anything. They enhance the reading experience. It's believed foreknowledge of outcomes is anagalous to <em>perceptual fluency</em> - an experience associated with aesthetic pleasure and story engagement. And, as <em>schema discrepancy theory</em> suggests, increased predictability
can result in increased positivity of affective response.</p>
			<p>So ... yay for me and my spoilers!</p>
			<p>Now, let's find out how the dog is going to cark it, shall we? Go ahead, click the dog's head.</p>
