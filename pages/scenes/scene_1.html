		<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
		<p>Morris stood at the steps to his apartment. Fifty four of them. Fifty four steps. Morris had counted many times on the journey back and forth from IKEA to the car, from the car to the stairs, from the first stair to the fifty fourth.</p>
		<p>Morris had recently acquired this apartment. It was nice. Close to town, a minute’s walk to the park where he could throw a frisbee with his Chihuahua named Tank. Was moving into a new place exciting? Yes. Was dealing with your girlfriend's inability to leave the door open for more than thirty seconds incredibly frustrating? Absolutely.</p>
		<p>Morris pushes the flat pack with all his might up the stairwell. The concrete bites into the cardboard covering, a fine powder of brown scattered in his trail. Morris’ legs quickly go from tired to shaking as the oblong object rises, centimeter by centimeter. It’s like dragging the Queen Mary through a marsh of molten mars bars. One final push. Heave!</p>
		<p>The door. At the top of the staircase. Closed of course. “Lexi! Lexi!” Morris calls. No response. She must have gone back for the second load of <em>“Årstid”</em> lamps and <em>“Ormhassel”</em> teatowels. Damn. One hand on the flat pack, Morris fumbles around his jean pocket. He fishes his keys out, plugs them into the keyhole and pushes. The door flings open.</p>
		<p>The door. The shelving, 92 cm behind the door. The flat pack, 215 cm in length. Mathematics isn’t surrendering. Morris has a go at bending the flat-pack into a U shape. No success. Why on earth would Lexi put the bookshelf there. Of all places?! Morris lets go of the flat pack. “Lets go of” is an inaccurate term. The flat pack lets go of Morris. It tumbles down 4 flights of staircase. “Shit”.</p>

    <div class="narration left">
      <p>What a difficult situation Morris has found himself in! His life has been momentarily inconvenienced by the locking of a door. By poor communicative skills between him and his beloved Lexi. Shared understanding sadly just was not acheived. But already I feel like the story is getting a little dry. How about we spice it up.</p>
 			<p>The dog is going to have to die.</p>
 			<p>Oh! I'm so sorry. Spoilers! But really, as <em>Leavitt's and Christenfeld's</em> studies have shown, spoilers don't actually spoil anything. They enhance the reading experience. It's believed foreknowledge of outcomes is anagalous to <em>perceptual fluency</em> - an experience associated with aesthetic pleasure and story engagement. And, as <em>schema discrepancy theory</em> suggests, increased predictability
can result in increased positivity of affective response.</p>
			<p>So ... yay for me and my spoilers!</p>
			<p>Now, let's find out how the dog is going to cark it, shall we?</p>
