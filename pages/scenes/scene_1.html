		<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
		<p>Morris dragged the second load of flat packs up the flight of stairs. An enormous brown package with those four black lettered branded across the side: IKEA. He was not going to let this bookcase beat him. It was the third of seven boxes and his masculinity was at stake. It was like dragging the Queen Mary through a marsh of molten mars bars.</p>
		<p>Moving to a new apartment was stressful enough, But choosing IKEA furniture with his girlfriend was an absolute nightmare. Lexi wanted white; he wanted beech. Was this relationship ever going to work?</p>
		<p>The new flat was nice though. A minute’s walk to the park where he could throw a frisbee with his Chihuahua - and best friend - Tank.</p>
		<p>Morris finally reached the landing and dropped the flatpack. The door was locked. “Lexi! Lexi!” Morris called. No response. She must have already gone back to IKEA for the next load of crockery, pans and soft furnishings.</p>
		<p>He wondered how Lexi had left so quickly while he fished into his pocket. Morris heaved the fluffy, diamond encrusted keychain out of his pants with a loud rip. Morris sighed.</p>

      <p>The girlfriend’s a dud. So what? I already feel like the story is getting a little dry. How about we spice it up.</p>
 			<p>The dog is going to have to die.</p>
 			<p>Oh! I'm so sorry. Spoilers! But really, as <em>Leavitt's and Christenfeld's</em> studies have shown, spoilers don't actually spoil anything. They enhance the reading experience. It's believed foreknowledge of outcomes is anagalous to <em>perceptual fluency</em> - an experience associated with aesthetic pleasure and story engagement. And, as <em>schema discrepancy theory</em> suggests, increased predictability
can result in increased positivity of affective response.</p>
			<p>So ... yay for me and my spoilers!</p>
			<p>Now, let's find out how the dog is going to cark it, shall we? Go ahead, click the dog's head.</p>
