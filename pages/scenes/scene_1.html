		<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
		<p>Morris stood at the steps to his apartment. Fifty four of them. Fifty four steps. Morris had counted many times on the journey back and forth from IKEA to the car, from the car to the stairs, from the first stair to the fifty fourth. Was moving in to a new place exciting? Yes. Was dealing with your girlfriend's inability to leave the door open for more than thirty seconds increadibly frustrating? Absolutely.</p>
		<p>Morris pushes the flat pack with all his might up the stairwell. The concrete bites into the cardboard covering, a fine powder of brown scattered in his trail. Morris’ legs quickly go from tired to shaking as the oblong object rises, centimeter by centimeter. It’s like dragging the Queen Mary through a marsh of molten mars bars. One final push. Heave!</p>
		<p>The door. Closed of course. Because for what reason might we leave our door open? One hand on the flat pack, Morris fumbles around his jean pocket. He fishes his keys out, plugs them into the keyhole and pushes. The door flings open.</p>
		<p>The door. 203 cm by 76.2 cm. The flat pack. 217 cm by 93 cm. The shelving, 92 cm behind the door. Mathematics isn’t surrendering. Morris has a go and warping the flat-pack into a U. No success. Why would Jen put the bookshelf there. Of all places?! Morris lets go of the flat pack. “Lets go of” is an inaccurate term. The flat pack lets go of Morris. One step at a time, a washing machine full of pebbles tumbles down 4 flights of stair. “Shit”.</p>
