		<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

		<p>Lexi’s old share house was a Victorian terrace. It cast an angular shadow over Morris. Ivy crept up its brickwork and lichen bloomed along the rusty iron lace.</p>
		<p>Morris had faked his love of this filthy cat since his first date with Lexi. “So cute”, “just adorable” she had cooed.</p>
		<p>Lexi had picked it up off the street, she’d said. How could anyone abandon a kitty cat, she’d said. Morris just shrugged and stayed silent. Morris could already see the muzzle marks wiped across the windows. The oily fur on his blanket. The spray on his pillow.</p>
		<p>And now that they were moving in, she wanted to bring her dumpster diving pet?</p>
		<p>The stench of ammonia hung in the air. Perfect. Schrödinger was home.</p>
		<p>As he entered the house he shuffled through the hallway and into the kitchen.</p>
		<p>Morris glimpsed the British Shorthair. He lunged forward and clutched the furball. “Pretty Kitty” he grimaced.</p>


    <div class="narration right">
      <p>Schrödinger the cat is alive right now. But he might soon face his demise.<br> It’s time to let this cat out of the box. How will your choice affect the outcome here? Will it be the difference between one cat, or six hundred cats perishing?</p>
			<p>Their lives are in <em>your</em> hands.</p>
