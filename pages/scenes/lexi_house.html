		<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

    <p>The car pulled up to the side of the street. The phosphorescent street lights emitted a dull orange glow. It was going to be a cold Sydney night. Morris stepped out.</p>
    <p>Lexi’s house was an old terrace building that cast a behemoth shadow over Morris. Exposed brickwork crept up its walls like ivy and lichen bloomed along the damp corners of the home.</p>
    <p>The stench of ammonia hung in the air. Perfect. Schrödinger was home.</p>
    <p>Morris could not stand the creature. Lexi had picked it up of the street. Morris could already see the muzzle marks wiped across the front windows.</p>
    <p>Morris found the brass key covered by a very conspicuous rock on the front verandah. As he entered the house he shuffled through the hallway and into the kitchen. The putrid aroma of  a thousand herbal teas left him dizzy.</p>
    <p>Morris saw the british shorthair. He lunged forward and clutched the furball.</p>

      <p>Schrödinger the cat is alive right now. But he might soon face his demise. It’s time to let this cat out of the box. To find out whether he will live or die.</p>
