		<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

    <p>The car pulled up to the side of the street. The phosphorescent street lights emitted a dull orange glow. It was getting late. Morris stepped out. He paced along the pavement, finally reaching his destination. The house. Across the road.</p>
    <p>Morris planted himself over the double white lines that extended along the bitchumen. The violent bellow of the horn smashes through his thoughts. Morris glares at the driver. Couldn’t he see what Morris is doing? Couldn’t he see Morris’ intention? Another blaring toot. Morris sighes and continues his walk forward, his anguished audience member driving off up the road.</p>
    <p>The creme white terrace building lay before Morris. Exposed brickwork crept up its walls like ivy. Green paint was flaking off the railing onto a decaying verandah and lichen bloomed along the damp corners of the home.</p>
    <p>It smelt like cat piss.</p>
    <p>Perfect. Carbucketty was home. Morris could not stand the creature. Lexi had picked it up of the street. Morris could already see the muzzle marks wiped across the front windows.</p>
    <p>Morris finds the brass key cowering under a very conspicuous rock on the front verandah. He unlocks the house and enters.</p>
    <p>Morris shuffles past the bookshelves, the tables and desks, the stacks of folders, books and aging parchment that make a skyline out of the living room. The floor is barely visible under the thick rug of documents. A hurricane of dust is kicked up as Morris enters the kitchen and the putrid smell of a thousand herbal teas nearly knock him out. He lashes out and grabs the dreamcatcher to relieve his dizziness. </p>
    <p>He spots it. The grey british shorthair staring at Morris from its perch upon the lounge back.</p>
    <p>Morris lunges forward and picks up the furball.</p>

      <p>Ah. Finally. Retribution. You tell me. What shall Morris do with Carbucketty?</p>
