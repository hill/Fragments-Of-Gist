    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <p>Calling...</p>
    <p>Calling...</p>
    <p>Calling...</p>
    <p>No Answer. Typical.</p>
    <p>Morris takes a deep sigh. He looks back at Tank. He’ll have to deal with the dog later. Now there is a much more important job. Dealing with Lexi. Showing her what she had done wrong. Morris is going to go to IKEA.</p>
    <p>He closes the door behind him as he heads down the fifty four stairs. Morris enters the shared garage and finds his car in lot thirty three. He unlocks the car, hops in the front seat and turns the ignition. The evening sunset glares through the windscreen and Morris pulls down the visor. A card drops into his lap.</p>

      <p>What a coincidence! It’s almost as if this exact moment was written for this exact character experiencing [some] of these exact issues in order to convey a higher meaning...</p>
 			<p>So you tell me. Does Morris visit Lexi at IKEA, or visit <em>Mr Tartu: World Famous Spritual Healer and Problem Solver</em></p>
