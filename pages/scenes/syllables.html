      <p>There we are! No room for interperative intonation and lexical stresses now! Ha! It does of course rely on the fact that they will pronounce the letters as show. That they know what to do. That they won't say "L dash E H dash K forward-slash". It still relys on a shared context. This will not do.</p>
