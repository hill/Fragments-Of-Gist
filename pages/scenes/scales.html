    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <p>Morris sits opposite the solicitor, across a mahogany desk.</p>
    <p>The bald bespectacled man shifted in his seat. He glanced at the characters. The sentences and phrases; the clauses and subclauses.</p>
    <p>Morris was going to sue his girlfriend. What was she thinking! Six screws?! Who just leaves six screws out of a perfectly good, perfectly well documented piece of flat pack furniture like that.</p>
    <p>Morris would ruin Lexi. He would take everything she once owned and loved and reduce it to dust through the brilliance of the modern legal system!</p>
    <p>The legal documentation was drafted.</p>
    <p>The solicitor carefully plucked each word to ensure that there could be no misinterpretation at all.</p>
    <p>The words formed sentences. The sentences formed paragraphs. The paragraphs formed bricks. The bricks formed walls.</p>
		<p>Walls of text.</p>
		<p>Walls defending from the intrusion of ambiguity.</p>

      <p>Morris really took it to the extreme. There’s no way Lexi could defend herself without a trained legal professional.</p>
      <p>Is this <em>“legalese”</em> even writing at all?</p>
