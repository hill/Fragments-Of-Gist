    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <p>Morris sits opposite the solicitor across the mahogany table.</p>
    <p>The bald bespectacled man shifted in his seat as he glanced of the characters, the sentences and the phrases. Slowly but surely scribbling out lines and annotating verbs back in.</p>
    <p>Morris is going to do it. Morris is going to sue his girlfriend. There is no place in society for people like Lexi. For people who don’t care about the safety and livelihood of pets and animals. What was she thinking! Six screws?! Who just leaves six screws out of a perfectly good, perfectly well documented piece of IKEA furniture like that.</p>
    <p>The legal documentation is being drafted.</p>
    <p>The solicitor is carefully plucking each word, phrase and clause to ensure no misinterpretation at all. </p>
    <p>The words begin to form sentences. The sentences begin to form paragraphs. The paragraphs begin to form blocks. The blocks begin to form walls. Walls of text. </p>
    <p>Walls of text defending from an intrusion of ambiguity and comprehensibility…</p>
