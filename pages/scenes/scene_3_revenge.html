		<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

    <p>Morris knew it was Lexi. She had a thing for not following instructions, and not reading the lines carefully. They’re not even words! They’re symbols!</p>
    <p>Morris breathes a deep sigh. He stared at Tank. He’ll have to clean up the mess later. There’s a much more important job to deal with now. This woman, this girlfriend. Morris trusted her - they were going to move in together. He couldn’t believe it. How had he been so shortsighted to not see this true evil that lay at his doorstep. Now was the time to express his pain.</p>
    <p>Morris left his apartment and found his car in lot thirty three of the garage. The engine revved and the car lurched forward as it hurtled down Carlisle street.</p>
    <p>It’s time to make Lexi feel the consequences of her actions and frankly her blatent disregard for Morris’ property and life!</p>

    <div class="narration right">
      <p>What fiendish ploy does Morris have in store for his unsuspecting lover?</p>
      <p>But let’s, just for a moment,  consider the above passage, dear reader. I worry that the audience may not discern the lexical stresses and nuanced intonation that has been applied to this body of text.</p>
			<p>I have a voice! I am a person! This faceless slab of text is devoid of emotion and interactivity that is inherent in face-to-face storytelling.</p>
			<p><em>Barthes</em>, <em>Levi-Strauss</em>, <em>Todorov</em> and <em>Propp</em> are consumed with narrative only defined by its basic structures - plot, characterisation and meaning through language - to even consider the conversational dynamics of storytelling. <em>Levi-Strauss</em>’ analysis of the Oedipus myth or <em>Propp’s</em> dissection of Russian folklore do not examine actual discourse strategies that are so effective at conveying meaning or what my good friend <em>David Herman </em> likes to call <em>“The Performative Dimension”</em> in <em>Towards a Transmedial Narratology.</em></p>
			<p>These words are being uttered. But I have no control over the utterances! Sure… I italicise things for emphasis but that requires a shared understanding (a shared context) of what intonation and vocal stress should be applied to a piece of text that is italicised.</p>
      <p>Imagine! Just imagine how a reader could be annunciating these words in their own heads…</p>
