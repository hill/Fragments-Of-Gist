		<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

    <p>Lexi. Morris knew it. Lexi had a thing for not following instructions. For not reading the lines carefully.</p>
    <p>Poorly interpreting the words on the IKEA instruction pamphlets. They’re not even words! They’re symbols! Does she not understand simple spatial reasoning? Morris takes a deep sigh. He looks back at Tank. He’ll have to deal with the dog later. Now there is a much more important job. Dealing with Lexi. Expressing his pain to his ignorant girlfriend.</p>
    <p>He closes the door behind him as he heads down the fifty four stairs. Morris enters the shared garage and finds his car in lot thirty three. He unlocks the car, slumps into the front seat and turns the ignition.</p>
    <p>The engine revs, the car lurches forward and speeds out of the garage. Pedestrians leap out of the way as the car hurdles down Carlisle Street.</p>
    <p>Expressing his pain to his ignorant girlfriend.</p>
    <p>Expressing <em>his</em> pain to his ignorant girlfriend.</p>
    <p>What better way to express pain then through retribution. Make the perpetrator feel the crime. Make Lexi feel the consequence of her action.</p>
    <p>The car flies down the streets. A blur of violent red amongst a backdrop of luscious green foliage. </p>
    <p>Morris isnt' going to speak to Lexi. </p>
    <p>Morris is going to <em>speak</em> to Lexi.</p>


    <div class="narration right">
      <p>Oooooh. What fiendish ploy does Morris have in store for his unsuspecting lover?</p>
      <p>However I worry, dear reader. I worry that the audience will not discern the lexical stresses applied to this body of text that I have applied in my head. In my own voice.<br>Bartes would want to tear these sentences up.</p>
      <p>These words are being uttered. But I have no control over the utterances! Sure… I italicise things for emphasis but that requires a shared understanding (a shared context) of what intonation and vocal stress should be applied to a piece of text that is italicised.</p>
      <p><em>Utterances have no other content than the act by which they are uttered.</em></p>
      <p>Imagine! Just imagine how a reader could be annunciating these words in their own heads…</p>
