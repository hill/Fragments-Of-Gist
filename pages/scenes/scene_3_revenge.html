		<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>Morris knew it was Lexi. She had a thing for not following instructions.</p>
<p>Morris stared at Tank’s half exposed body. He’d have to clean up the mess later. There was a much more important job to deal with now.</p>
<p>This woman. Morris trusted her!</p>
<p>How had he been so shortsighted to miss this true evil that lay in his own bed?<br>Now was the time to express his pain.</p>
<p>Morris strode out of his apartment and made a beeline for his car.</p>
<p>Lexi would have to feel the consequences of her actions.</p>

			<p>What fiendish ploy does Morris have in store for his unsuspecting lover?</p>
			<p>But I worry, dear reader. I worry that the audience may not discern the nuanced intonation that has been applied to this body of text.</p>
			<p>I have a voice! I am a person! But this faceless slab of writing is devoid of emotion and interactivity that is inherent in face-to-face storytelling.</p>
			<p>Barthes, Levi-Strauss, Todorov and Propp are consumed with narrative that is only defined by its basic structures - plot, characterisation and representation through language - to even consider the conversational dynamics of storytelling. Levi-Strauss’ analysis of the Oedipus myth or Propp’s dissection of Russian folklore do not examine actual discourse strategies that are so effective at conveying meaning.</p>
			<p>But my good friend David Herman celebrates <em>“The Performative Dimension”</em> of storytelling: intonation, pace and tone.</p>
			<p>As you read this story, I have no control over your internal utterances!</p>
			<p>Sure… I italicise things for emphasis but that requires a shared understanding of what vocal stress should be applied.</p>
			<p>Just imagine how a reader could be annunciating these words in their own heads…</p>
