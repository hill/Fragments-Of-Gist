    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <p>Morris ignores the card and continues on his journey to speak to Lexi. To communicate his frustrations to her. To make her feel the consequence of her action.</p>
    <p>The engine revs, the car lurches forward and speeds out of the garage. Pedestrians leap out of the way as the car hurdles down Carlisle Street. The metal cocoon rushes through the traffic lights, over the curving hills, flings around the roundabouts and down the main street only to find…</p>
    <p>… traffic. Of course. A standstill. Trapped between a Peugeot and a Toyota. Nowhere to go. Morris slumps in agony. </p>
    <p>But something catches Morris’ eye. A storefront. Unassuming. A grey exterior with frosted glass windows. A solicitor’s office.</p>
    <p>Morris has an idea.</p>

    <div class="narration">

      <p>Traffic. There’s nothing worse than sitting in traffic isn’t that right?</p>
      <p>I suppose your dog being crushed by unstable home furniture and appliances could be considered worse. But there’s nothing worse <em>at the time</em> then sitting in traffic.</p>
      <p>Should Morris stay sitting in traffic a go to IKEA, or should he follow his curiosity and visit the solicitor?</p>
